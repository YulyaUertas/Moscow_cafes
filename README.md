Market research in the Moscow foodservice industry to make a decision on opening a new establishment/Исследования рынка общепита в Москве для принятия решения об открытии нового заведения

Market research based on open data in the foodservice industry, presentation preparation.

A market study was prepared using open data about foodservice establishments in Moscow, and the obtained data was visualized. 
Based on the data, a location was chosen for opening a new coffee shop. I used seaborn and plotly libraries to create the graphs.
